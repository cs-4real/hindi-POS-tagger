# Hindi POS Tagger using NLTK and TnT (Trigram'n'Tag)

This project builds a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger for **Hindi language** using NLTK's `TnT` (Trigrams'n'Tags) tagger trained on the Indian corpus provided by NLTK.

It also includes:

- Custom fallback heuristics to handle unknown (UNK) tokens
- Accurate tagging of Hindi punctuation like `à¥¤` and symbols like `|`
- Custom tokenization for Devanagari script to ensure correct sentence parsing
- Final model evaluation with fallback for improved accuracy
